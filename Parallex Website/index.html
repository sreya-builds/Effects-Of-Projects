        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Website</h2>
        <p>A parallax scrolling experience transforms a simple webpage into a layered journey where every movement reveals a new visual depth.As the user scrolls, foreground elements shift quickly while background layers drift slowly, creating a sense of immersion. This controlled motion guides the viewer’s eye naturally, helping them explore the content at their own pace. Through these subtle transitions, storytelling becomes more dynamic and visually engaging. Ultimately, parallax design makes exploration feel intentional, turning movement itself into part of the narrative.</p> <br> <br>
        <p>In a well-crafted parallax section, each visual layer plays a specific role in enhancing the mood of the page. Faster-moving elements create tension or excitement, while slower layers add calmness and atmosphere. This balance allows designers to highlight important parts of the story without overwhelming the viewer. By blending motion with meaning, the experience becomes more than just animation—it becomes guided discovery. Such interactions make the page memorable, encouraging users to scroll further and stay engaged.</p> <br> <br>
        <p>As the viewer reaches the final section of a parallax page, the motion begins to settle, creating a sense of closure and resolution. The layered visuals come together to reinforce the theme or message that the designer wants to convey. This smooth transition from movement to stillness helps the user absorb the content more clearly. When done effectively, the ending feels natural and satisfying, leaving a lasting impression. In this way, parallax scrolling not only decorates a webpage but also shapes the entire storytelling experience.</p><br> <br>
